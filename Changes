        - Initial release - CPAN DAY - 2015-08-16
        - based on the released code from early 2014
        - This is a library to provide a schema for
          storing benchmark values in an SQL database
        - Primarily targets mysql, SQLite support
          is basically so far by cutting away known
          trouble maker SQL statement parts
        - Read more about the schema on http://benchmarkanything.org/
